Magnesium Extras adds a lot of features to Magnesium or Rubidium (Forge Sodium) to improve the mod. It includes several features from other mods, packaged into one add-on that you'll want to install for the best experience.

Magnesium/Rubidium Dynamic Lights is packaged as a separate mod, in order to be able to load without Magnesium installed. 

 

Features

Better Performance. This mod fixes multiple issues with Sodium and Forge itself to improve performance. It has a patch mitigating random lag spikes in highly modded environments, and a patch fixing a Forge bug that was slowing down Sodium's chunk updating.
Better FPS Counter. Looks nicer, and can be customized to display minimum frametimes (useful for debugging lag on tick) and average frametimes over the last 15 seconds (for accurate benchmarking)
Zoom key! A port of "Ok Zoomer" from Fabric, bound to C, allows you to view far away objects more easily.
Borderless Fullscreen. Minecraft's default mode makes it hard to tab out. This is off by default, but replaces the vanilla Sodium fullscreen option.
Entity Culling. Improve performance in modpacks drastically by not rendering far away entities. Includes a configurable Y value so you can disable rendering mobs in caves while you're on the surface. Can be configured or disabled. Incompatible with Out Of Sight, because that mod does the same thing, and doesn't support Sodium anyway.
Chunk Fade In. A port of "Fade In Chunks" from Fabric, this applies the Bedrock effect to reduce the pop-in effect from newly loaded chunks, either when you load in the game, switch worlds, or are just flying around. Can be configured or disabled.
Fog Toggle. An option to turn off all fog, which is missing from vanilla Sodium.
Configurable Cloud Height. Vanilla clouds are quite low, and there's no other mod to raise them on Forge. This mod defaults them to being a bit higher.
Integration With Magnesium/Rubidium Dynamic Lights. This mod works perfectly with MDL, and improves its performance drastically with its optimizations. If you have MDL, you'll want to install this mod.
 

Note: the Forge fix to speed up Magnesium/Rubidium chunk updating is experimental and not 100% safe (removing "unnecessary" synchronize blocks on "immutable" HashMaps). It's theoretically fine, and I've used it for a while in a 300 mod modpack with no issues, but I need to leave this warning. If you experience unexpected crashes, let me know on the Github Issues page.
